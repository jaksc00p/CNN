# Transformer

CNN is a lightweight, stand-alone, Visual Studio 2022 C# Console Application that implements the Convolutional Neural Network architecture.
The demonstration example is image recognition of hand written digits. The images have 28 x 28 pixels and are stored in text format. 
The project is intended for educational purposes, since the performance is not good enough for larger practical use cases.
There are no third-party dependences; matrix operations, automatic differentiation etc. is implemented from scratch.

## Usage

Edit the settings in Program.cs and compile and run with Visual Studio.
